- 👋 Hi, I’m @Flankie. You can call my Alex considering that is my real name.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code to the fullest of understanding. I code using Python and Java.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning both Python and Java, as I feel those are the easiest coding languages, along with being the most presistant.
- 💞️ I’m looking to help people make projects by giving ideas and maybe even coding. (Once I learn enough, that is.)
- 📫 You can reach my via Discord; "flankie#9058", Reddit; "u/flankielmao", Twitter; "@FlankieYT", There is more ways to contact me, but these are the ways I'm more
likely to respond to the message.
